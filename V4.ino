IMPORTANT NEXT STEPS FOR EXPERIMENTATION (IF YOU CHOOSE TO PROCEED):

1.  HARDWARE CONNECTION:
    *   Connect the I2S_DATA_PIN (through a small series resistor, e.g., 50-100 ohms for impedance matching) to your RF output circuit.
    *   You will need:
        *   **Bandpass Filter (95 MHz or your chosen carrier frequency):**  ESSENTIAL to filter out unwanted harmonics and noise.
        *   **RF Amplifier (Optional, but likely needed for any range):** To boost the signal power.
        *   **Antenna (95 MHz band, 50 ohms impedance):**  For radiating the RF signal.

2.  SPECTRUM ANALYZER:
    *   Connect a spectrum analyzer to the output of your circuit (after the filter, amplifier, and before antenna).
    *   OBSERVE THE SPECTRUM:
        *   Verify if you have a signal near your CARRIER_FREQUENCY (e.g., 95 MHz).
        *   Check the level of harmonics and spurious emissions. The signal quality will likely be very poor.
        *   Tune an FM receiver to your target frequency and see if you can receive anything (quality will be very low).

3.  TEST IN SHIELDED ENVIRONMENT:
    *   Perform all initial tests in a shielded environment to prevent unwanted RF radiation.

4.  ADJUST PARAMETERS (Experiment carefully):
    *   CARRIER_FREQUENCY: Change to your desired FM frequency (within the FM band, e.g., 87.5 - 108 MHz).
    *   MODULATING_FREQUENCY: Change to different audio frequencies to test modulation.
    *   MODULATION_INDEX: Adjust to control the FM deviation (how much the frequency varies).
    *   SAMPLE_RATE:  Experiment with slightly different I2S sample rates, but 80 MHz is a starting point.

5.  LEGALITY:
    *   RE-READ THE WARNINGS AT THE TOP OF THIS CODE.
    *   UNDERSTAND THE LEGAL RISKS OF UNLICENSED FM TRANSMISSION IN RUSSIA.
    *   DO NOT BROADCAST PUBLICLY WITHOUT A LICENSE.
